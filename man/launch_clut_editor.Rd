Opens the interactive Color Lookup Table (CLUT) Editor in your web browser.
The CLUT Editor allows you to visually design and customize HSV color space
partitions for color classification, with 3D visualizations and coverage
statistics.
}
\details{
The CLUT Editor provides:
\itemize{
\item Visual editing of HSV color space boundaries for each color category
\item Real-time coverage statistics showing gaps and overlaps
\item Multiple visualization modes: hue slices, 3D cone, 3D scatter, hue wheel
\item Export to R code or JSON for use with \code{charisma()}
\item Import/export functionality for sharing custom CLUTs
}

Custom CLUTs created with the editor can be validated using \code{validate()}
and then used in \code{charisma()} analyses via the \code{clut} parameter.
